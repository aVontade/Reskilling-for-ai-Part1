# Project Plan: Manus AI for Business

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the project plan and technical specification for building "Manus AI for Business," a B2B SaaS platform designed to help organizations navigate the challenges of workforce transformation in the AI economy. The platform will operationalize the frameworks and insights from the "Reskilling for the AI Economy" book, providing business leaders and HR departments with a strategic toolkit for assessment, planning, and execution.

This plan details the core components, technology stack, feature specifications, and a development roadmap for building the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

## 2. Core Architectural Components

The platform will be built on a modern, scalable, and maintainable service-oriented architecture. The core components are:

*   **Frontend (Web Application):** A responsive single-page application (SPA) providing all user-facing dashboards, forms, and visualizations.
*   **Backend (API Server):** The central engine handling all business logic, data processing, user management, and serving data to the frontend via a REST API.
*   **Database:** The primary data store for all application data, including users, companies, assessment results, and job role mappings.
*   **User Authentication & Authorization:** A dedicated service to manage user identity, roles (admin, manager), and permissions securely.
*   **AI/ML Service Layer:** A specialized layer of services responsible for executing the AI-powered features, such as the maturity assessment analysis and the job role evolution mapping. This layer will integrate with external LLMs and manage our internal models and prompts.
*   **Task Queue / Asynchronous Worker:** A system for handling long-running, non-blocking background processes, such as generating detailed reports or running complex analyses.
*   **Integration Layer:** A component designed to handle integrations with third-party systems, such as existing Learning Management Systems (LMS) or Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS).

## 3. Proposed Technology Stack

The following technology stack is proposed to balance developer productivity, performance, scalability, and ecosystem support.

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **Framework:** **React (using Next.js)** for its robust ecosystem and server-side rendering capabilities.
    *   **UI Library:** **Material-UI (MUI)** for a comprehensive set of pre-built components.
    *   **Data Visualization:** **Recharts** for building interactive charts and graphs within React.
    *   **State Management:** **Redux Toolkit** for predictable and scalable application state management.

*   **Backend:**
    *   **Language/Framework:** **Python with FastAPI** for its high performance, async support, and seamless integration with the Python AI/ML ecosystem.
    *   **API:** **REST API** with Pydantic for robust data validation.

*   **Database:**
    *   **Primary Database:** **PostgreSQL** for its reliability, power, and flexibility.
    *   **Vector Database:** **Pinecone** or **Weaviate** will be considered post-MVP for more advanced semantic search and RAG capabilities.

*   **User Authentication & Authorization:**
    *   **Managed Service:** **Auth0** to handle authentication securely and efficiently.

*   **AI/ML Service Layer:**
    *   **Core Libraries:** **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, and **spaCy**.
    *   **LLM Integration:** API integration with a state-of-the-art model like **OpenAI's GPT-4** or **Anthropic's Claude 3**.
    *   **Deployment:** Services will be containerized with Docker and deployed as scalable microservices or serverless functions (**AWS Lambda**).

*   **Task Queue / Asynchronous Worker:**
    *   **Framework:** **Celery** with **Redis** as the message broker.

*   **Deployment & Infrastructure (DevOps):**
    *   **Cloud Provider:** **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.
    *   **Containerization:** **Docker**.
    *   **Orchestration:** **AWS ECS** or **AWS App Runner** for the MVP, with the option to scale to Kubernetes (EKS) later.
    *   **CI/CD:** **GitHub Actions** for automated build, test, and deployment pipelines.

## 4. Key Feature Specifications

### 4.1. AI Maturity Assessment
*   **Objective:** Allow a company to benchmark its AI readiness against the "AI Maturity Pyramid" and track progress.
*   **User Flow:**
    1.  A user completes a comprehensive questionnaire covering strategy, technology, skills, and ethics.
    2.  The system scores the answers and presents a personalized dashboard.
    3.  The dashboard shows the company's position on the AI Maturity Pyramid, benchmarks them against their industry, and provides actionable recommendations for improvement.
*   **Implementation:** A questionnaire-based tool with a backend for scoring logic and a frontend featuring rich data visualizations (pyramids, radar charts).

### 4.2. Job Role Evolution Mapper
*   **Objective:** Help HR managers map existing job roles to future, AI-augmented roles and identify skill gaps.
*   **User Flow:**
    1.  An HR manager inputs a job role and its core tasks.
    2.  The system uses an LLM to analyze each task's automation potential.
    3.  It generates a "Future Role Profile" showing how the role will change and what new skills are required, based on the book's frameworks.
*   **Implementation:** An interactive frontend for data input, with an LLM-powered backend service performing the analysis and skill-gap identification.

### 4.3. Internal Training Program Builder (Post-MVP)
*   **Objective:** Help L&D managers create customized internal training programs based on identified skill gaps.
*   **User Flow:**
    1.  The user selects skills from the Role Mapper output.
    2.  The system generates a draft curriculum with suggested learning modules and curated content (internal or external).
    3.  The user can customize and export the curriculum.
*   **Implementation:** A drag-and-drop UI for curriculum building, with AI-powered content curation and potential for LMS integration.

### 4.4. AI Opportunity Audit (Post-MVP)
*   **Objective:** Help business leaders identify high-value opportunities for AI augmentation.
*   **User Flow:**
    1.  A user completes a guided questionnaire about their company and goals.
    2.  An AI service analyzes the input to generate a prioritized report of AI initiatives, complete with an impact vs. effort matrix.
*   **Implementation:** An asynchronous process using a task queue to call a prompted LLM, with results displayed in a dynamic report.

## 5. MVP Development Roadmap

The MVP will be built in approximately 14 weeks, focusing on delivering core assessment and planning value.

*   **Phase 1: Foundation & Core Backend (~4 weeks)**
    *   **Focus:** Project setup, CI/CD, cloud infrastructure, and core backend services (user auth, DB schema).
    *   **Outcome:** A secured, deployed API with basic user management.

*   **Phase 2: The AI Maturity Assessment (~4 weeks)**
    *   **Focus:** Building the first end-to-end feature: the questionnaire, scoring logic, and results dashboard.
    *   **Outcome:** A user can complete the assessment and receive immediate, actionable insights.

*   **Phase 3: Job Role Evolution Mapper (~4 weeks)**
    *   **Focus:** Building the second core feature, including LLM integration and the "Future Role Profile" UI.
    *   **Outcome:** A user can analyze a job role to understand its evolution and identify skill gaps.

*   **Phase 4: MVP Polish & Beta Launch (~2 weeks)**
    *   **Focus:** E2E testing, performance optimization, UI/UX refinement, and setting up analytics/monitoring.
    *   **Outcome:** A stable, polished MVP ready for a limited beta launch.

### Post-MVP Plan
*   **V1.1:** Implement the **Internal Training Program Builder**.
*   **V1.2:** Implement the **AI Opportunity Audit**.
*   **V2.0:** Introduce **Enterprise Features** (Team Management, Org-wide Dashboards, SSO, LMS/HRIS Integrations).
